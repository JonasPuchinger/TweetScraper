# Introduction #
`TweetScraper` can get tweets from [Twitter Search](https://twitter.com/explore). 
It is built on [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) without using [Twitter's APIs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).
The crawled data is not as *clean* as the one obtained by the APIs, but the benefits are you can get rid of the API's rate limits and restrictions. Ideally, you can get all the data from Twitter Search.

**WARNING:** please be polite and follow the [crawler's politeness policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler#Politeness_policy).
 

# Installation #
1. Install selenium python bindings: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html. (Note: the `KeyError: 'driver'` is caused by wrong setup)

2. Run:
    
    ```
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Usage #
1. Change the `USER_AGENT` in `TweetScraper/settings.py` to identify who you are
	
		USER_AGENT = 'your website/e-mail'

2. In the root folder of this project, you can run the following commands: 

		scrapy crawl TweetScraper -a query="foo,#bar"

	where `query` is a list of keywords seperated by comma and quoted by `"`. The query can be any thing (keyword, hashtag, etc.) you want to search in [Twitter Search](https://twitter.com/search-home). `TweetScraper` will crawl the search results of the query and save the tweet content and user information.

3. The tweets will be saved to disk in `../Data/tweet/` in default settings and `../Data/user/` is for user data. References to conversations will be saved in `../Data/conversation` The file format is JSON. Change the `SAVE_TWEET_PATH` and `SAVE_USER_PATH` in `TweetScraper/settings.py` if you want another location. If you provide a query with a Twitter username in it, like so `from:username` or `to:username`, TweetScraper will generate a subfolder with that username in the specified directories.
